# CYSE-PROJECT


**Project Overview:**
   The purpose of our project is to develop an autonomous system that continuously monitors a collection of files and scans them for potential malware threats.
This system will be designed to run in the background, automatically detecting and analyzing files in real-time or at regular intervals, without the need for manual intervention. 
By leveraging advanced scanning techniques and algorithms, the system aims to identify malicious software, such as viruses or malware, that could pose a threat to the integrity and security of the file system.
The goal is to ensure that any harmful files are detected promptly and quarantined or flagged for further analysis, and then an alert or notifaction is sent to and admin,
providing an added layer of protection against cybersecurity risks and helping maintain the overall safety and stability of the system.
